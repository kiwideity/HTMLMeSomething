	<h3>Lessons from Christchurch</h3><br>
	<img alt="Policewoman wearing headscarf" height="698" src="images/policehijabsm.jpg" width="458"><br>
	<span class="auto-style3">Like most New Zealanders I was stunned by the 
	attack on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch">Christchurch
	</a>mosques that killed 50 people including a 3 and 4 
	year old child. I weep at the senseless violence and loss of precious lives.
	<br>
	<b>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</b><br>
	I contrast this to my carefree childhood and mourn the loss of my former 
	countries innocence.<br>The policewoman in this picture is wearing a head 
	scarf in solidarity with the moslem community and a rose to mourn those lost 
	in the&nbsp; 
	tragedy. Many New Zealand women have followed the prime ministers lead 
	and are wearing headscarves to show their support for the New Zealands 
	moslem community and New Zealanders have formed human chains of protection 
	around mosques for Friday prayers.<br>
	<img alt="Solidarity" height="334" src="images/scarvessm.jpg" width="500"><br>
	<br>When asked by President Trump what the US could do to help, the prime 
	minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinda_Ardern">Jacinda 
	Ardern</a> responded "by showing love and compassion to moslems everywhere".
	Its bittersweet that such a tragedy has led to my my proudest moments as 
	a Kiwi. "They are us" <br>

	<h3>My US Life</h3><span class="auto-style3">I came to the 
	US in early 2006 with my two year old son in tow.<br><br>&nbsp;<img alt="Neo" height="708" src="images/IMG_20121013_123333-01.jpeg" width="362"><br>
	<br>We soon found acceptance and love within the St Louis community and I 
	married an American late that year. Unfortunately my husband became 
	chronically ill two years into our marriage and got progressively worse over 
	the next 7 years and died on 5/23/17.<br>
	<img alt="Troy Lee Arnold" src="images/troy.jpg"><br>Miss you Baby 	<img alt="heart" height="45" src="images/heart.png" width="50"><br><br>I was 
	overwhelmed by the love and support of my colleagues and the Washington 
	University community.<br>Since then my son and I have healed and are 
	embracing life in the US. I very much enjoy my work at the university and 
	the camaraderie of my colleagues who as smart as they are amusing. My son loves 
	the US and is in every way an American. I'm still a bit of a hybrid but am 
	learning to love my adopted country and to enjoy its many splenders. We have a good life here and 
	are grateful for the many opportunities this country offers. We continue our 
		journey toward becoming US citizens and look forward to contributing to this 
		fine country. <h2>Thank you USA.</h2>

<h1>My Kiwi Life</h1>
	<p>I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> and grew up in a beautiful country known for 
	its friendliness and hospitality. Each year the first of the spring lambs 
	are displayed proudly on the front page of the
	<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times">Waikato Times.</a></p>
	<p>Long summers were spent at the beach running wild, swimming, fishing and 
	generally experiencing a freedom my son will never know.</p>

	<p>As I got older I enjoyed horse riding through many of New Zealands 
	Forests.</p>
